# A design system is:
- a <ins>collection of reusable components</ins> with clear standards that <ins>can be assembled together to build any number of applications</ins>.

## A design system enables teams to build:
- better products,
- faster.

## A design system is:

- **_consistent_** : components are built and managed by a predictable pattern.
- **_self-contained_** : is treated as a standalone dependency.
- **_reusable_** : components can be reused in many contexts.
- **_accessible_** : components follow the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/), which means the app caters for all users (regardless devices used or personal disabilities).
